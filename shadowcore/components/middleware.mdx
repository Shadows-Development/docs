    Middleware is currently only available for commands. More middleware types will be added in future releases.

# Command Middleware

Middleware in ShadowCore allows you to execute logic before and after a command's execution. It is useful for tasks like logging, validation, permission checks, or modifying the command's behavior. You can define middleware for specific commands or globally for all commands.

## 📂 Middleware Structure
Middleware in ShadowCore are organized within the `/middleware` directory and categorized into subfolders.

**Example Folder Structure:**
```
/middleware/command/ping.ts 
/middleware/command/ban.ts 
/middleware/command/kick.ts
```

## ⚙️ Properties

The CommandMiddleware component allows you to specify the following properties:

```md
| Property         | Type     | Description                                                   |
|------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`           | string   | The name of the middleware. It can be specific to a command (e.g., "ping") or global (e.g., "global"). |
| `beforeExecution` | function | The function to run before the command executes. Should return `true` to allow the command to run. |
| `afterExecution`  | function | The function to run after the command has executed. |
```

## 🧩 Usage

You can create middleware for specific commands or for all commands globally. The `beforeExecution` function runs before the command executes, and the `afterExecution` function runs after the command has finished executing.

### Specific Command Middleware
This middleware will only apply to a specific command. For example, you can create middleware for the `ping` command:
```ts
import { CommandMiddleware } from "shadow-core";

export default new CommandMiddleware({
    name: "ping",
    beforeExecution: async (interaction, command) => {
        console.log("Ping Before");
        return true; // Continue with command execution
    },
    afterExecution: async (interaction, command) => {
        console.log("Ping After");
    },
});
```
In this example:
- The `name` is `"ping"`, so this middleware will only apply to the `ping` command.
- The `beforeExecution` function is executed before the command runs.
- The `afterExecution` function is executed after the command completes.

### Global Command Middleware
Global middleware applies to all commands. It is useful for tasks like logging or permission checks that should be applied universally.
```ts 
import { CommandMiddleware } from "shadow-core";

export default new CommandMiddleware({
    name: "global",
    beforeExecution: async (interaction, command) => {
        console.log("Global Before");
        return true; // Continue with command execution
    },
    afterExecution: async (interaction, command) => {
        console.log("Global After");
    },
});
```
In this example:
- The `name` is `"global"`, so this middleware will apply to all commands.
- The `beforeExecution` and `afterExecution` functions will be run for every command.

## 🔄 Execution Flow
The middleware's `beforeExecution` function is called before the command executes. If `beforeExecution` returns `false`, the command will be blocked and will not execute.

After the command runs, the `afterExecution` function is called. This happens regardless of whether the command was successful or not. `afterExecution` only runs if `beforeExecution` returned `true`.

## 🔧 Middleware Order

ShadowCore executes middleware in the order they are registered. For example:

1. Global middleware is executed first.
2. Specific command middleware is executed second.
3. The command itself is executed.
4. Global middleware's `afterExecution` is executed.
5. Specific command middleware's `afterExecution` is executed last.

This allows for layered logic and flexibility.

## 🎯 Example: Logging Middleware
You can use middleware to log the execution of each command:
```ts
import { CommandMiddleware } from "shadow-core";

export default new CommandMiddleware({
  name: "global",
  beforeExecution: async (interaction, command) => {
    console.log(`Command ${command.name} is about to run.`);
    return true;
  },
  afterExecution: async (interaction, command) => {
    console.log(`Command ${command.name} has finished executing.`);
  },
});
```
In this case, the middleware logs when a command starts and finishes.
