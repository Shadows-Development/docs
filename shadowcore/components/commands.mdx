# Commands Component

The **Commands Component** in ShadowCore provides a structured way to define, manage, and execute commands within your Discord bot. This system ensures modularity, scalability, and ease of use.

## ðŸ›  Overview
ShadowCore's command system automatically loads and organizes commands from designated directories. Each command is defined in its own file, following a standardized structure.

### Key Features:
- **Automatic Command Registration**: Commands are dynamically loaded from folders.
- **Built-in Argument Parsing**: Supports extracting arguments from user input.
- **Permissions & Cooldowns**: Restrict commands based on roles and enforce rate limits.
- **Middleware Support**: Pre/post-execution middleware for additional logic.

## ðŸ“‚ Command Structure
Commands in ShadowCore are organized within the `/commands` directory and categorized into subfolders.

**Example Folder Structure:**
```
/commands/general/ping.ts 
/commands/admin/ban.ts 
/commands/moderation/kick.ts
```

Each command file must export a command object containing its configuration and execution logic.

## ðŸ”§ Command Object Structure
A command in ShadowCore follows this basic structure:

```ts
import { Command } from "shadow-core";

export default new Command({
    name: "example",
    description: "This is an example command.",
    run: async (interaction) => {
        await interaction.reply("Hello from ShadowCore!");
    },
});
```
```md
| Property       | Type     | Description                                      |
|---------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `name`        | string  | The command's name (used for invocation).        |
| `description` | string  | A short description of the command.              |
| `options`     | array   | (Optional) Command options for arguments.        |
| `run`         | function | The function executed when the command is used. |
