# Getting Started

Welcome to ShadowCore! This guide will help you set up your development environment and create your first bot using ShadowCore.

## üì¶ Installation

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** (Version 18 or higher)
- **[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)** (or Yarn/Pnpm)
- **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)** (optional, but recommended)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install ShadowCore
<Warning>
    **Installing ShadowCore globally is **not required**. It is only recommended if you want easy access to the CLI once it is fully finished. You can skip this step for now.**
</Warning>
To install ShadowCore globally, run:

```
npm install -g shadow-core
```

Or, if you prefer using it locally within a project:

```
npm install shadow-core
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Setting Up a New Bot

Since the CLI `init` command is not available yet, you'll need to manually set up your bot.

#### **Step 1: Create a New Project Folder**
```
mkdir my-bot && cd my-bot
```

#### **Step 2: Initialize a `package.json`**
Run the following command and follow the prompts:
```
npm init -y
```

#### **Step 3: Install ShadowCore**
Inside your bot's directory, install ShadowCore:

```
npm install shadow-core
```

#### **Step 4: Create the Bot's Entry File**
Create a new file called `index.ts` (or `index.js` if using JavaScript) and open it in your editor.

Paste the following basic bot setup:

```ts
import { Bot } from "shadow-core";
import { GatewayIntentBits } from "discord.js";

// Replace with your bot's token
const token = "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"; // Replace with your Bots token
const GUILD_ID = "YOUR_GUILD_ID"; // Replace with your server's ID

// Initialize the bot
export const bot = new Bot(
  token,
  [GatewayIntentBits.Guilds, GatewayIntentBits.GuildMessages, GatewayIntentBits.MessageContent],
  false // Debug mode disabled
);

// Log when the bot is ready
bot.getClient().once("ready", () => {
    console.log(`‚úÖ Logged in as ${bot.getClient().user?.tag}`);
    bot.getCommandManager().registerCommands(GUILD_ID);
});
```
<Info>
    **You can get your bot's token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).** 
</Info>
#### **Step 5: Run Your Bot**

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Typescript
  npx ts-node index.ts
  ```
  ```bash JavaScript
  node index.js
  ```
</CodeGroup>
